            <p> My Name is Corey Post, I am a soon to be father of 2. My oldest is Clara Grace and she is 3, way too much energy and my little shadow.
              My second one, Carter David, is due first week of August and I am hoping he will be as easy as my daughter. I have been with my wife for 
              5 years.
            </p>
            <p>I am currently interested in a career change from working on vehicles since I was a teenager to something that interests me alot and that I can 
              apply my problem-solving skills in. Programming is very unique and I enjoy learning something new from it everyday. 
              I started this journey going back to college at Weber State and then transitioned into the U of U bootcamp in hopes of reaching my goal in being 
              a programmer in the field. My goal is to take all the knowledge I have gained from college and the full stack bootcamp and take those tools to 
              apply my years of problem-solving and translate it to all work in the Full Stack industry.
            </p>
            <p>My hobbies include playing video games on my computer, continuing learning how to be a future full stack developer, and spending time with my family. 
              I enjoy watching professional played video games such as: CSGO, LOL, Smite, and Rainbow Siege. I also enjoy traditional sports,
              my favorite teams are: Chicago Cubs and White Sox in the MLB, Notre Dame Fighting Irish in college football, and Chicago Blackhawks in hockey.
