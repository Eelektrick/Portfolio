## My Journey with Portfolio

Thought about keeping the same look and adding the differences required.

But I wanted to change some of the look up from the previous version. 

I believe this is a better looking outcome compared to the previous iteration.

Took longer than expected with the adjustments to work with the linear gradient background.
